        <h2>Graphic Object Transformations</h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>
        As described in <a href="position_size.html">Graphic Object Position and Size</a>, each Shape object can be moved and sized and using methods
        such as <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#setLocation-double-double-" target="_blank">setLocation(...)</a>
        and <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#setSize-double-double-" target="_blank">setSize(...)</a>.
        This approach to moving and resizing Shapes has limitations, including the inability to rotate a Shape object.
        Consider for a moment, how would you draw an oval rotated at a 45&deg; angle? This is not possible using
        <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#setLocation-double-double-" target="_blank">setLocation(...)</a>
        and <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#setSize-double-double-" target="_blank">setSize(...)</a>.
        Fortunately, there is another way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most computer graphics systems implement a concept called <span style="font-style:italic;">graphics transformations</span>.
        The easiest way to understand how graphics transformations work is to imagine that each and every object has its own coordinate system.
        As described in <a href="model.html">DoodlePad Drawing Model</a>, when a new DoodlePad Shape object is created
        its coordinate system is set up with the origin in the upper left corner of the Pad window,
        x-coordinate values increasing from left to right, y-coordinate values increasing from top to bottom, and distances measured in pixels.
        Graphics transformation functions give you the ability to move and modify the coordinate system of each and every Shape object independently.
        For example, it is possible to create two Rectangle Shapes, both with their location set to (0, 0), but appearing at different parts of the Pad.
        If the coordinate system of one is <span style="font-style:italic;">translated</span> to another part of the Pad,
        then the two Rectangle Shapes would not be drawn at the same location in spite of the fact that they had the same x- and y-coordinate values.
    </p>
        <img src="images/transformations1.png" style="float:right;padding:10px;">
    <p>
        For example, the image on the right depicts two Rectangle Shapes, both with dimensions 50 pixels &times; 50 pixels
        and coordinates x=0, y=0. One Rectangle has a red fill and the other has a green fill.
        The difference between the two Shapes is that the green Rectangle has been transformed by translating it to the
        location (100, 100). In other words, the origin of the green Rectangle's coordinate system has been moved (translated) to (100, 100).
        In spite of the fact that both Rectangles have identical dimensions and location,
        they are drawn at different parts of the Pad due to the fact that the green Rectangle's coordinate system was translated away from its default value.
    </p>
    <h3>Translate</h3>
    <img src="images/transformations2.png" style="float:right;padding:10px;">
    <p>
        As suggested by the terminology used in the previous example,
        the coordinate system of a Shape may be moved in the x- and y-directions by invoking a Shape object's
        <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#translate-double-double-" target="_blank">translate(...)</a> method.
        The translate(...) method takes two double arguments.
        The first indicates how far to move the Shape's coordinate system in the x-direction,
        and the second indicates how far to move the Shape's coordinate system in the y-direction.
        The following example program implements the previous red/green Rectangle example using DoodlePad.
        The class constructor creates two Rectangle objects with identical location and dimension values, but different fill colors.
        Following this, only the green Rectangle is translated by (100, 100) by executing the statement
        <span class="code">grnRect.translate(100, 100)</span>.
        Because the starting location of the green Rectangle is (0, 0), after the translation by (100, 100), the new coordinates
        for the origin of the green Rectangle is (100, 100).
        The image on the right illustrates the result of executing the following example program.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="java">import doodlepad.*;

public class Transform1 {
    private Rectangle redRect;
    private Rectangle grnRect;

    public Transform1() {
        // Two Rectangles with identical location and dimensions
        redRect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 50, 50);
        grnRect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 50, 50);

        // Set fill colors
        redRect.setFillColor(255, 0, 0);
        grnRect.setFillColor(0, 255, 0);

        // Translate the green Rectangle only
        grnRect.translate(100, 100);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Transform1 myTransform1 = new Transform1();
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Translations are cumulative, as are all transformations.
        If we create a Shape object, translate it by (50, 50), and then translate it by (50, 50) a second time,
        the Shape's coordinate system will have its origin located at (100, 100).
        Use the Shape's <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#reset--" target="_blank">reset()</a>
        method to set all transformations back to their default values.
    </p>
    <h3>Scale</h3>
    <p>
        The second transformation method is
        <a href="http://doodlepad.org/dist/javadoc/doodlepad/Shape.html#scale-double-double-" target="_blank">scale(...)</a>.

    </p>
    <h3>Rotate</h3>
